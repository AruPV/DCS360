ANALYSIS
--------

All histograms have a red line that marks the mean, an blue dotted lines that mark the 5% and 95% quantiles.
The top three histograms vary in the time (0.5 years, 1 year, 2 years, while the bottom three vary in the 
amount of probability estimates (10, 100, 1000)

There are clear pattern that are visible in both. Regarding the top row, as time increased, the top of 
the distribution got flatter and there were less outliers; The curve also shifted to the left, as more 
people were beginning to lose more money as time increased. Overall however, most estimates did fall lower than .865 (lower
than even the lowest 5% percentile, evidenced in the last one.Regarding natural sampling variance, plenty could still be 
evidenced in the last of the tow row, but it was nonetheless closer to a normal distribution.

The bottom row has even sharper differences between the three graphs. The leftmost barely resembles any kind of pattern.
If you squint you might be able to figure that it could be normal if there was more data, but the data there is is fairly
scattered. The mean falls to the left of the peak of the distribution, the second bucket fdrom the left has no data, and
in general it is hard to make out any patterns from it.

The one after begins to show something akin to normal distribution, and the mean falls closer to the peak of the curve.
There is a sharp drop after the first bucket to the right of the mean however, which hints at there still not being
enough data to properly call this a normal distributino

The last one is the least noisy one, and while some natural sampling variance is evidenced (as it will always be) it
by far looks the most like a normal distribution. Buckets tend to be symmetrical (except for the ones right next to
the peak, which look anything but). This is to be expected from an increase in the sample size
